# Vanilla-Essentials-Config
A config for the plugin EssentialsX that removes their awful replacements of vanilla features and only keeps the good ones.
E.g. Not being able to use selectors(@s, @a, @e, etc.) with /kill because their replacement command doesn't support them(despite not adding any new features that the vanilla command doesn't already have.)
